PixelTheater is a platform for creating interactive LED animations on different shaped models constructed from PCBs.

## Software

PixelTheater's main open-source firmware project is [DodecaRGB-firmware](https://github.com/Pixel-Theater/DodecaRGB-firmware), which powers the DodecaRGB LED model and provides tools for animation, hardware integration, and development. In additionl to the 3d led models, we also have clocks, message blocks and other projects.

## LED Models

### DodecaRGB v2.2

The DodecaRGB is a 12-sided electronic sculpture featuring 1,620 addressable RGB LEDs, creating stunning light animations. Powered by a Teensy 4.1 microcontroller and the PixelTheater library ([GitHub](https://github.com/pixel-theater/)), it's portable and battery-operated with integrated power management and charging. This kit contains the custom control board that handles power, LED control, sensors, and user interaction.

### DodecaRGB Cube v1.0

### Icosododecahedron v1.0

The Icosododecahedron is a 20-sided electronic sculpture featuring 2,300 addressable RGB LEDs - 12 pentagons and 20 triangles, an insane amount of LEDs. Powered by a Teensy 4.1 microcontroller and the PixelTheater library ([GitHub](https://github.com/pixel-theater/)), it's can be used with the same hardware as the DodecaRGB v2.2. 

## Other Projects and Kits

### Clock Kit 1.1

The Clock Kit 1.0 is an easy kit for building a colorful 7-segment clock using stackable PCBs. It can be driven from any microcontroller, and comes with example firmware and ESPHome-compatible configuration that lets you change colors or add interactivity with your smarthome. Or you can string together more digits to show any number you want.

### RGB Message Block

The **RGB Message Block** is a modular, chainable 5x7 RGB LED sign based on WS2812 LEDs. Each block displays four characters (20 LEDs wide, 7 LEDs tall) and measures just 60x24mm, making it perfect for compact, customizable displays. Multiple blocks can be connected together to create longer messages or larger displays.
